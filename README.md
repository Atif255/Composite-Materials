# Composite-Materials

Composite material is a multicomponent material made from two or more components with significantly different physical and/or chemical properties that, when combined, result in a new material with characteristics that are different from those of the individual components and are not a simple superposition of them. It is customary to distinguish a matrix and fillers in the composition of a composite, the latter performing the function of reinforcement (by analogy with reinforcement in a composite building material such as reinforced concrete). The fillers of composites are usually carbon or glass fibers, and the role of the matrix is played by the polymer. The combination of different components improves the characteristics of the material and makes it both light and durable. At the same time, the individual components remain as such in the structure of the composites, which distinguishes them from mixtures and hardened solutions. By varying the composition of the matrix and filler, their ratio, and filler orientation, a wide range of materials with the required set of properties is obtained. Many composites are superior to traditional materials and alloys in their mechanical properties and at the same time they are lighter. The use of composites usually makes it possible to reduce the weight of a structure while maintaining or improving its mechanical characteristics. Modern composites are made from different materials: polymers, ceramics, glass and carbon fibers, but the basic principle remains the same. This approach also has a drawback: even if we know the characteristics of the original components, determining the characteristics of the composite consisting of these components is quite problematic. There are two ways to solve this problem: physical testing of material samples, and the second is predicting characteristics. The essence of forecasting is to simulate a representative element of the volume of the composite, based on data on the characteristics of the incoming components (binder and reinforcing component). Therefore, the relevance of the chosen topic is due to the fact that the created predictive models will help reduce the number of tests performed, as well as replenish the materials database with possible new characteristics of materials, and digital twins of new ones. In addition, an adequately functioning prediction model can significantly reduce the time, financial and other costs of testing. Therefore, it is necessary to develop models that predict tensile modulus and tensile strength, as well as a model that recommends the matrix-filler ratio.

The relevance lies in the fact that the created predictive models will help reduce the number of tests performed, as well as replenish the materials database with possible new characteristics of materials, as well as digital twins of new composites. Initial data on the properties of composite materials, presented in two data sets X_bp and X_nup.
